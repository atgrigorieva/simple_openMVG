A simple GUI for a workflow with openMVG for Linux.

# Install instructions:

Just copy the file in the openMVG_Build over your openMVG_Build installation.

Execute /openMVG_Build/software/SfM/simple_openMVG

Follow instructions.

# Further reading

This project consists of a "frontend" (simple_openMVG) written in qt and a "backend" workflow written in python.

While the GUI currently offers only the basic functions you can adjust the settings in the workflow.py file.

Any help is greatly appreciated
