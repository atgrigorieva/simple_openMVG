My work is of course CC3 share alike.

The work is based on the runQProcess script by http://toto-share.com/author/totosugito/
Download original: http://toto-share.com/2011/07/qt-qprocess-tutorial/

The workflow is based on the original tutorial_demo.py file (see openMVG main project)

I don't own any of the pictures, that have been attached for testing purposes (ImageDataset_SceauxCastle)
